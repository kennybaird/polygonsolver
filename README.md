The Times daily polygon puzzle presents a list of optional + one mandatory letter, from which you have to find wordtypes.  
It seems a bit fuzzy on wordtypes, they should not be plurals nor PROPs but sometimes are.
Anyway I am awful at the game, I just brute force combinations on their site so I thought I would write this to do it for me
But - as you shall see - I am awful at code, too

The Times daily polygon puzzle presents a list of optional letters, one mandatory letter, and a min word count, from which you have to find wordtypes at least the length of the minimum count.

It seems a bit fuzzy on wordtypes, they should not be plurals nor PROPs but sometimes are.
Anyway I am awful at the game, I just brute force combinations on their site so I thought I would write this to do it for me

It just looks through a word list I found here. https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt
Making requests a requirement to open the URL directly seems overkill

But - as you shall see - I am awful at code, too
